# BioEngineering 10

This course is designed to introduce undergraduates to the types of problems that bioengineers solve and the concepts they apply to solve them. Various types of devices -- from genetically engineered bacteria to biosensors -- will be discussed, and we will explore the physics and biology necessary to understand and design each of these devices. In addition, students will learn how to work effectively in groups and communicate their results in a professional manner.

## Objectives
To introduce students to the field of bioengineering and, in general, to thinking about problems and
solutions in the field ethically and effectively.
