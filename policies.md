## Course Description

This course is designed to introduce undergraduates to the types of problems that bioengineers solve and the concepts they apply to solve them. Various types of devices -- from genetically engineered bacteria to biosensors -- will be discussed, and we will explore the physics and biology necessary to understand and design each of these devices. In addition, students will learn how to work effectively in groups and communicate their results in a professional manner.

**Objectives:** To introduce students to the field of bioengineering and, in general, to thinking about problems and solutions in the field ethically and effectively.

## Course Format

- Live Lecture on Tu/Th 11:00A-12:29P in 105 Stanley Hall
- Discussion Sections at various days/times and locations
    - 50-minute in-person discussion sections with required attendance (will not be recorded)
    - Two excused absences allowed

## Important Notes

- Class recordings and materials should not be shared with people outside of the class (though
they may be shared with DSP). The copyright is held by the instructor.
- The instructors cannot help you get into, or switch discussion sections within, the course. These
must be managed via the [Student Information System](https://sis.berkeley.edu/help/enrollment-faq/switching-related-sections).
- There will be no Discussion sections or office hours during the first (truncated) week of class
(8/23 - 8/25). Sections and office hours will begin to meet on the following Monday (8/28).
- There will be no Discussion sections or GSI office hours during the week of Thanksgiving
(Monday 11/20 - Friday 11/24).
- There is no textbook for the course, but online readings will be assigned.
- BioE 10 does not have a final exam. The final exam time slot is automatically given to us by the
campus and will not be used.
- You will need to access journal articles for this class. If you are not using the campus network,
you may need to follow [these instructions](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/help/connect-off-campus) for library access.
